                 Results Explanation        

 There are three indicators : mutex, space, and element.
 The process waits for the appropriate semaphore to read
 from the shared buffer to ensure a suitable buffer slot
 exists. After the handle is gathered, the process uses
 it to read from the buffer slot, then updates the
 indicator and signals to the correct semaphore to inform
 the other process bank of the changes in the buffer structure.
 The space semaphore will mutually exclude any process in the
 same bank from modifying the indicator associated with that
 bank when another process is already using it. Which is known
 as process blocking. The extra blocking causes the system
 response delay. When the buffer-array is full the producer
 cannot put any items into the buffer because there is no room.
 So, the producer waits until the consumer clears space. When
 the scheduler runs the consumer next it will remove an element
 from the buffer, and then send a signal to the producer. The
 producer receives the signal, and will awake and begin
 processing again since space in the buffer is now available.

 The random sleep time indicates a counter variable whose
 contents change to reflect the amount of free buffer slots.
 Thus, depending on the random sleep time, there will yield a
 difference in producers and consumers because of the difference
 in sleep vs awaken at given time upon the buffer space.
